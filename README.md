Colorblinding
==========

Developed by <a href='https://github.com/LeonardoCardoso' target='_blank'>@LeonardoCardoso</a>. 

An extension for Google Chrome (and Chromium) that simulates the website as a color vision impaired person would see. 
So you, as a developer, can adjust the colors for their accessibility.

Important
------------

- If the website already uses a filter in its css, the elements might change their original location when applying Colorblinding. To get them back, just select the option <b>deactivate</b> and refresh the page if it doesn't do it by itself.
- Colorblinding works in all tabs and the filter is applied when the tab is <b>fully loaded<b>.
